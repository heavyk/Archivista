# Archivista

this will become something like an archive hub. making archives transparent, almost as if they were file systems.

right now, it's obviously a total rip-off from [https://github.com/eduardolundgren/node-zip-archiver]

I want to shape it into something bigger though. I want it to be able to do more things..

right now it only does Zip files...

# WIP!
